# DiscreteMachineLearning
MNIST object recognition using discrete components

The goal of this project is to make a discrete component "machine" that will recognize digist from the MNIST dataset with an error rate lower than 25%.

The project is divided into 4 tasks.
   1. Determine minimum requirements for sensor array
   2. Determine minimum requirements for ML model
   3. Determine minimum requirements for object recognition hardware
   4. Prototyping and final design
   
The directory structure is built around the tasks defined above.
